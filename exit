    chat, problem management work
    
    fixed bugs:
    * saves problems when you navigate away to another problem.
    * logs you out when you navigate away to another problem.
    need to implement:
    * log you out when you leave problem
    * show whos viewing the same project as you
    
    added functionality
    *ctrl-s to save
    *enter to submit chat comments
    
    probably some others; it got a bit messy there for a while

    Made c# project
    
    Haven't updated in a while.
    I have
    * uploaded a basic project
    * created a homepage "index"
    * created a browsing page "browse"
    * implemented a login system where all registration/login is handled on
    the index page, log off is handled on the browse page
    * partially implemented real time chat using signalR, with a different
    group for each problem topic. Haven't been able to fully implement this
    as am waiting on other parts to be setup. (chat with different groups
    works, hasn't been linked to the problems yet)
    * have setup a database with 3 tables: users, problems and chat comments
    
    Next work needed:
    * 'crud' commands for problems at both db and user interface level
    * 'crud' commands for chat comments at db level, user interface is
    pretty well setup
    * display of problems in a content editing pane in the center of the
    page
    * integration with our preferred editor
